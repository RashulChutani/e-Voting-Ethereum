# e-Voting-Ethereum
With each passing day, we hear concerns being raised on the accuracy of EVMs. The cause being elections based on central authority based systems. In this case, the election commission and the election officials form the trustable third-parties. The problems associated with the current EVM based centralized-voting system are:
- EVM tampering concerns are rising.
- The anonymity of the voter is not maintained.
- Low-Voter Turnout owing to far-away polling booths and long-queues outside booths.
- The amount spent in conducting elections and counting of votes is massive.
- Results are available only after a fixed number of days, containing human-bias error due manual adding of votes.

_With Blockchain disrupting all the "central-authority" based systems, Voting Systems are no exception._ We propose to form an e-Voting platform based on Blockchain, where Voting data is stored in a blockchain and is immutable and auditable. This system offers the following benefits:

- Verifiable and Immutable Voting Database is maintained over Blockchain.
- The anonymity of Voters is maintained using Crypto-systems.
- High-voter turnout owing to e-elections and pooling-booths only for people without internet-connectivity.
- Instant Results.
- Exponentially low Expense

_Issues of scalability in Blockchain has no significance in e-Voting Systems as only a single vote(transaction) is cast per individual. Also, the election can be conducted in phases._
